# Porfolio Project
This is a portfolio project that I am in the process of building. It's built using Ruby on Rails. Sqlite database is used in 
Development Environment but will be moved to PostgreSQL when deployed to production.

# Installation
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/zeehn/MyPortfolio.git
cd MyPortfolio
bundle install 
```
